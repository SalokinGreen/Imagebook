Welcome to the imagebook, a [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) tampermonkey extension that allows you to add images to your lorebook entries. Not the prettiest, but it works. It's the first version, so there might be unkown bugs!

## Warning

This script is not affiliated with NovelAI in any way. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage caused by this script.

## Known Issues

- Naming an entry to the same name as an existing entry will overwrite the existing entry's image.
- The extension depends on loose class names, so if NovelAI changes their class names, the extension will break. Make sure to check back here for updates.
