## Warning

This script is not affiliated with NovelAI in any way. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage caused by this script.

## Known Issues

- Naming an entry to the same name as an existing entry will overwrite the existing entry's image.
- The extension depends on loose class names, so if NovelAI changes their class names, the extension will break. Make sure to check back here for updates.
- The extension only works on a specific story, so if you copy or import a story, its imagebook entries will not be copied or imported.
- Deleting an entry will not delete its image, and deleting the story will not delete its imagebook entries.
- Not enough testing to make sure there are no bugs.
